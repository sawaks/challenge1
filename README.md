This project is proof of understanding module 1. I learned basic HTML, CSS, and GitHub through week 1.

## My Task

## Main points of modification

  Make up syntactic elements and add "alt" to img element for accessibility.

  Organizing selectors and properties and following the semantic structure of the HTML elements for long-term sustainability.
